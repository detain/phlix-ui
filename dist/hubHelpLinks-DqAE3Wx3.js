	"my-servers": {
		links: [e("hub/what-is-the-hub", "What is the hub?"), e("hub/claim-server", "Claiming a server")],
		details: "These are the Phlix servers you have claimed to your hub account. Claiming a server links it to you so you can reach it from anywhere without knowing its address. A server shows Online when the hub has heard from it recently, Connecting while a relay tunnel is still being set up, and Offline when it has gone quiet. Browse opens the library and is only available once the relay is active; Manage opens the server’s own admin page directly; Remove unlinks the server from your account without deleting anything on the server itself."
	},
	"server-detail": {
		links: [e("hub/server-detail", "Server details")],
		details: "A single server’s status in detail. Server Info shows its version, whether it is currently reachable, its last heartbeat, and the hostnames and subdomain the hub knows it by. Relay Session appears when a tunnel is open and reports the worker node handling it and the bytes carried. TLS Status appears once the server has a fully-qualified name with a certificate. Heartbeat History is the recent record of check-ins the hub uses to decide whether the server is online."
	},
	federation: {
		links: [],
		details: "Federation links whole Phlix servers together as peers so their libraries can be shared across the group, rather than sharing library-by-library with individual people. Adding a peer needs that server’s address and public key, which its operator supplies. This is an administrator feature: the hub restricts these actions to admins, so if you are not an administrator the page will only show a load error. There is no user guide for federation yet, which is why there is no documentation link here."
	},
	"federation-shares": {
		links: [],
		details: "The library shares that flow between federated servers. The Incoming tab lists libraries other peers have offered to this server, which you can Accept or Reject while they are pending. The Outgoing tab lists libraries this server has offered to its peers. Like the Federation page, this is an administrator feature and non-administrators will see only a load error. Federation shares are distinct from the personal library shares on the Manage Shares page, which are between people rather than between servers."
	},
	"manage-shares": {
		links: [e("hub/library-sharing", "Library sharing"), e("hub/share-with-friends", "Sharing with friends")],
		details: "The libraries you have shared with other people. Each row shows who you shared with, the permission level they were granted, and an expiry date if you set one — an expired share is marked and no longer grants access. Revoke ends a share immediately. This is the granting side of sharing; the libraries other people have shared with you appear under Shared With Me."
	},
	"shared-with-me": {
		links: [e("hub/library-sharing", "Library sharing"), e("hub/share-with-friends", "Sharing with friends")],
		details: "The libraries other people have shared with you. Each card shows the owner, the server the library lives on, and the permission level you were given — read-only, or read and write. Only shares that are currently active are listed; if an owner revokes a share it simply stops appearing here. This is the receiving side of sharing; the libraries you have shared with others appear under Manage Shares."
	},
	"invite-links": {
		links: [e("hub/invite-links", "Invite links")],
		details: "Invite links let you give someone access to a library on one of your servers by sending them a URL, without them needing an account beforehand. New Invite creates a link scoped to a server and optionally a single library and permission level; you can cap how many times it may be used and when it expires. The list shows each link’s usage against its limit; Copy URL copies it to send, and Revoke disables it. A revoked or fully-used link stops working immediately."
	},
	"mcp-tokens": {
		links: [],
		details: "MCP tokens are personal access tokens an MCP client — Claude Desktop, an agent runner, an editor plugin — presents to this hub so it can act for you. A token is bound to your account, never to a single server: which servers it can reach is re-checked against what you own at the moment of every call, so a token can never see a server you do not own. Scopes only narrow it further. The token itself is shown exactly once, when you create it: the hub stores only a hash, so it cannot be looked up or re-sent afterwards, and losing it means revoking the token and creating a new one. Revoke takes effect immediately and does not wait for the token to expire."
	},
	requests: {
		links: [e("hub/requests", "Media requests"), e("reference/api/hub-media-requests", "Requests API reference")],
		details: "Requests let you ask a server owner to add a specific movie or show. New Request takes the title and its TMDB id — and, for a series, an optional season and episode. A request moves from Pending to Approved or Rejected as the owner acts on it; a rejected request shows the reason. Delete withdraws a request you no longer want. Requesting something does not download it — it flags it for the owner to decide."
